        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring web designer, who enjoys learning and creating. Web developement is something im pursuing because it presents a challenge and lets me learn at my own discretion. I am confident in my abilities to learn and establish a portfolio within this field. I have gone through many jobs in life trying to figure out what I wanted. My career so far hasn't been much of one as I have struggled to find something that falls inline with what I value. This has come from experience and learning more about myself.</p>
        <p>Learning web development gives me a platform for creating and developing a brand for myself. I understand this won't be learned without consistency and patience. I know this is the field for me because it falls inline with what I value in a job.</p>
